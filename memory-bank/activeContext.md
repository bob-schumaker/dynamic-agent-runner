# Active Context

## Current Focus

- No implementation slice is currently active.
- The high-ROI queue has advanced through four major runtime foundations:
  capability/status visibility, approval/sandbox approval-before-side-effect
  policy, explicit MCP registry injection, and caller-registered input
  guardrails.
- The next recorded ROI focus in `specs/README.md` is bounded
  `iterative-agent-loop-runtime`.

## Recent Completed Work

- Capability status reporting is implemented:
  - public report contract and package inspection
  - metadata-only declarations
  - model adapter, tool registry, built-in tool-pack, approval, MCP, and
    guardrail collaborator/status reporting
  - invalid package reporting
- Approval/sandbox v1 baseline is implemented:
  - `ApprovalInterruptionState`, `ApprovalInterruption`, and
    `WorkflowInterruptedResult`
  - direct approval-required `tool_use_step` pause before handler invocation
  - no side effect before approval
  - redacted approval trace events
  - high-level `run_agent_workflow*` APIs fail clearly on interrupted workflows
  - sandbox work remains partial: approval-before-side-effect exists, but write,
    shell, workspace grants, sandbox adapters, and mutation audits remain
    deferred
- MCP v1 baseline is implemented:
  - `MCPToolBinding`
  - `registered_tool_from_mcp_binding(...)`
  - `create_mcp_registry(...)`
  - MCP-origin tool provenance
  - conservative hidden and approval-required defaults
  - live MCP registry-entry capability status
  - live MCP transports, process lifecycle, discovery, reconnect, cache, and
    diagnostics beyond metadata remain deferred
- Live guardrail v1 baseline is implemented:
  - `GuardrailDecision`, `GuardrailResult`, and `InMemoryGuardrailRegistry`
  - input guardrails run before first model/tool action
  - missing input adapters fail closed
  - abort decisions raise `GuardrailExecutionError`
  - redacted guardrail traces
  - capability status for missing/live input guardrail adapter coverage
  - output/tool phases, reject-content, warning-only behavior, retries,
    timeouts, and external adapters remain deferred

## Current Spec Authority Map

- Primary runtime contract:
  - `specs/dynamic-agent-runner/spec.md`
- Recently completed feature packages:
  - `specs/capability-status-report/spec.md`
  - `specs/approval-interruption-resume/spec.md`
  - `specs/sandbox-workspace-runtime/spec.md`
  - `specs/mcp-runtime-integration/spec.md`
  - `specs/live-guardrail-execution/spec.md`
- Next ROI feature package:
  - `specs/iterative-agent-loop-runtime/spec.md`
- Later feature packages:
  - `specs/skill-source-resolution/spec.md`
  - `specs/power-marimo-host-automation/spec.md`
  - `specs/async-session-memory-pipeline/spec.md`
  - `specs/llm-step-interpreter-middleware/spec.md`
  - optional local-model advisory specs:
    `specs/llmfit-model-fit-filter/spec.md` and
    `specs/llama-cpp-memory-fit-profile/spec.md`

## Next Steps

- Before implementing the next focus area, create a scoped plan/tasks/validation
  checkpoint for `iterative-agent-loop-runtime` and commit it.
- Keep loop runtime bounded behind the now-real policy surfaces:
  capability status, approval interruption, MCP registry provenance, and input
  guardrails.
- Preserve unit-test boundaries: fake clients, fake tools, fake MCP bindings,
  and fake guardrails only; no live OpenAI, MCP, Hugging Face, Marimo, or local
  model calls in core tests.
